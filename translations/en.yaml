# Glossary
glossary:
  irc:
    # Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a way to chat with text over the internet, similar to
    # Skype. However, you can run your own copy of IRC completely yourself, something you're
    # not able to do with Skype or similar hosted chat services.
    value: Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
  
  network:
    # An IRC network is an IRC service that someone's actually running. If someone's running
    # an IRC network, it means that two other people can connect to that network and chat to
    # each other.
    value: Network

  server:
    # An IRC server is a machine that runs an IRC server program. IRC networks are made of
    # one or more servers that connect to each other, and provide IRC services to the users
    # who connect to them.
    value: Server

  client:
    # An IRC client is a person or a program connected to an IRC server/network. I can
    # easily download an IRC client program, connect to a network, and start chatting!
    value: Client
  
  channel:
    # An IRC channel is a chat room. Each IRC network has many, many channels that clients
    # can connect to and chat with each other. For instance, if I connect to a chat room
    # called 'kittens', you could say I've joined the 'kittens' channel. Channel names in
    # IRC start with a hash symbol, so the kittens channel would be '#kittens'.
    value: Channel


# IRC Numerics
#
# Numerics are short strings presented to end users that either give them information, or
# are a response to a command the user's performed on the chat network.
numerics:
  "001":
    # This message is sent when the client connects, and introduces new users to the IRC
    # network.
    #   %=network=% is the name of the IRC network (e.g.  Freenode  ).
    #   %=userhost=% is a user identifier that also contains some technical details about
    #                   how they connected (e.g.  dan!username@127.0.0.1  ).
    value: Welcome to the %=network=% IRC Network %=userhost=%

  "002":
    # This message is sent when the client connects, and gives users more information
    # about the server they're connecting to.
    #   %=servername=% shows the name of the server that the user's connecting to
    #                   (e.g.  irc.oragono.io  ).
    #   %=version=% shows what version of software the server is running
    #                   (e.g.  ircd-kawaii-1.2.4  ).
    value: Your host is %=servername=%, running version %=version=%

  "003":
    # This message is sent when the client connects, and tells them when the server was
    # created (when it started running).
    #   %=datetime=% indicates the time and date when the server was created
    #                   (e.g.  Sat Jan 7 2017 at 12:04:42 EST  ).
    value: This server was created %=datetime=%
  
  "005":
    # This message is sent when the client connects, and indicates that the list of tokens
    # before this sentence are what the server supports. For instance, this is an example of
    # what can be sent when a client connects:
    #       CASEMP=rfc1459 CHANLIM=#:10 CHANMODES=eimprstz are supported by this server
    value: are supported by this server

  "010":
    # This message is sent to a client when they need to disconnect from the current server
    # and connect to a different one instead. A port is an IP (internet) term describing a
    # part of a server's internet address.
    value: Please use this server/port instead

  "251":
    # This message tells the user how many other clients are on the network, and how many
    # servers the network is made up of. ucount plus icount make up the total number of
    # users who are on the network.
    #   %=ucount=% are how many regular, non-invisible users are connected to the network.
    #   %=icount=% are how many invisible users are connected to the network (e.g.  354  ).
    #   %=scount=% are how many servers make up the network (e.g.  12  ).
    value: There are %=ucount=% users and %=icount=% invisible on %=scount=% servers

  "252":
    # This message tells the user how many priveledged users (administrators) exist on the
    # network. Typically, IRC admins are called 'operators'. For instance, the usual way
    # this message is sent is something like:
    #       0 operator(s) online
    # or
    #       1 operator(s) online
    # or
    #       31 operator(s) online
    value: operator(s) online
