# Glossary
glossary:
  irc:
    value: Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
    tl-note: >
      Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a way to chat with text over the internet, similar to
      Skype. However, you can run your own copy of IRC completely yourself, something you're
      not able to do with Skype or similar hosted chat services.
  
  network:
    value: Network
    tl-note: >
      An IRC network is an IRC service that someone's actually running. If someone's running
      an IRC network, it means that two people can connect to their network and chat to each
      other.

  server:
    value: Server
    tl-note: >
      An IRC server is a machine that runs am IRC server program. IRC networks are made of
      one or more servers that connect to each other, and provide IRC services to the users
      who connect to them.

  client:
    value: Client
    tl-note: >
      An IRC client is a person or a program connected to an IRC server/network. I can
      easily download an IRC client program, connect to a network, and start chatting!
  
  channel:
    value: Channel
    tl-note: >
      An IRC channel is a chat room. Each IRC network has many, many channels that clients
      can connect to and chat with each other. For instance, if I connect to a chat room
      called 'kittens', you could say I've joined the 'kittens' channel. Channel names in
      IRC start with a hash symbol, so the kittens channel would be '#kittens'.
